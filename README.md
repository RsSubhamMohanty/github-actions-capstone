# 🚀 GitHub Actions DevSecOps Capstone

A complete **CI/CD + DevSecOps pipeline** built using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, **Flask**, and **GitHub Security** features. This project demonstrates automated testing, Docker image building, vulnerability scanning, deployment simulation, and scheduled health checks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the complete software delivery process:

* ✅ Build & Test the application
* 🐳 Build Docker images
* 🔒 Scan Docker images using Trivy
* 📦 Push images to Docker Hub
* 🚀 Simulate deployment to Production
* ❤️ Scheduled Health Check
* 🔐 Secret Scanning & Push Protection
* 📦 Dependency Vulnerability Review

# ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflows

### 🔹 PR Pipeline

Runs whenever a Pull Request is opened or updated.

* Build & Test
* Dependency Vulnerability Review
* PR Status Check

---

### 🔹 Main Pipeline

Runs whenever code is pushed to the **main** branch.

Workflow:

```
Build & Test
      ↓
Docker Build
      ↓
Trivy Image Scan
      ↓
Docker Push
      ↓
Deploy (Simulation)
```

---

### 🔹 Health Check

Runs:

* Every 12 hours (Cron)
* Manually using `workflow_dispatch`

Steps:

* Pull latest Docker image
* Run container
* Check `/health`
* Generate GitHub Step Summary

---

# 🔒 DevSecOps Features

## ✅ Trivy Image Scanning

Scans Docker images for:

* HIGH vulnerabilities
* CRITICAL vulnerabilities

Pipeline fails if critical vulnerabilities are detected.

---

## ✅ Dependency Review

Checks newly added dependencies in Pull Requests.

If a dependency contains a Critical vulnerability, the PR fails automatically.

---

## ✅ GitHub Secret Scanning

Automatically detects leaked secrets such as:

* API Keys
* AWS Keys
* Docker Tokens
* Passwords

---

## ✅ Push Protection

Blocks a push if GitHub detects a secret before it reaches the repository.

---

## 🔑 Workflow Permissions

Workflows follow the **Principle of Least Privilege** by using:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

---

# ❤️ Health Endpoint

```
GET /health
```

Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

---

# ▶️ Run Locally

Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t github-actions-capstone .
```

Run container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 github-actions-capstone
```

Verify application

```
http://localhost:5000/health
```

Run health test

```bash
bash test.sh
```
